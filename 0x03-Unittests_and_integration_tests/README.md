# 0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests


Unit testing is the process of testing that a particular function returns expected results for different set of inputs. A unit test is supposed to test standard inputs and corner cases. A unit test should only test the logic defined inside the tested function. Most calls to additional functions should be mocked, especially if they make network or database calls.

The goal of a unit test is to answer the question: if everything defined outside this function works as expected, does this function work as expected?

Integration tests aim to test a code path end-to-end. In general, only low level functions that make external calls such as HTTP requests, file I/O, database I/O, etc. are mocked.

Integration tests will test interactions between every part of your code.

At the end of the projects it is important to know the following concepts:


* The difference between unit and integration tests.
* Common testing patterns such as mocking, parametrizations and fixtures



## TASKS


### 0. Parameterize a unit test


Familiarize yourself with the `utils.access_nested_map` function and understand its purpose. Play with it in the Python console to make sure you understand.

In this task you will write the first unit test for `utils.access_nested_map`.

Create a `TestAccessNestedMap` class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.

Implement the `TestAccessNestedMap.test_access_nested_map` method to test that the method returns what it is supposed to.

Decorate the method with `@parameterized.expand` to test the function for following inputs:

```nested_map={"a": 1}, path=("a",)
nested_map={"a": {"b": 2}}, path=("a",)
nested_map={"a": {"b": 2}}, path=("a", "b")
```
For each of these inputs, test with `assertEqual` that the function returns the expected result.

The body of the test method should not be longer than 2 lines.

### 1. Parameterize a unit test

Implement `TestAccessNestedMap.test_access_nested_map_exception`. Use the `assertRaises` context manager to test that a `KeyError` is raised for the following inputs (use `@parameterized.expand`):

```
nested_map={}, path=("a",)
nested_map={"a": 1}, path=("a", "b")
```
Also make sure that the exception message is as expected.


**File**: `test_utils.py`



### 2. Mock HTTP calls


Familiarize yourself with the `utils.get_json` function.

Define the T`estGetJson(unittest.TestCase)` class and implement the `TestGetJson.test_get_json` method to test that `utils.get_json` returns the expected result.

We donâ€™t want to make any actual external HTTP calls. Use `unittest.mock.patch` to patch `requests.get`. Make sure it returns a Mock object with a json method that returns `test_payload` which you parametrize alongside the `test_url` that you will pass to get_json with the following inputs:

```
test_url="http://example.com", test_payload={"payload": True}
test_url="http://holberton.io", test_payload={"payload": False}
```

Test that the mocked `get` method was called exactly once (per input) with `test_url` as argument.

Test that the output of `get_json` is equal to `test_payload`.


**File**: `test_utils.py`




### 3. Parameterize and patch


Read about memoization and familiarize yourself with the `utils.memoize` decorator.

Implement the `TestMemoize(unittest.TestCase)` class with a `test_memoize` method.

Inside test_memoize, define following class

```
class TestClass:

    def a_method(self):
        return 42

    @memoize
    def a_property(self):
        return self.a_method()
```
Use `unittest.mock.patch` to mock `a_method`. Test that when calling `a_property` twice, the correct result is returned but `a_method` is only called once using `assert_called_once`



**File**: `test_utils.py`





### 4. Parameterize and patch as decorators


Familiarize yourself with the `client.GithubOrgClient` class.

In a new `test_client.py` file, declare the `TestGithubOrgClient(unittest.TestCase)` class and implement the `test_org` method.

This method should test that `GithubOrgClient.org` returns the correct value.

Use `@patch` as a decorator to make sure get_json is called once with the expected argument but make sure it is not executed.

Use `@parameterized.expand` as a decorator to parametrize the test with a couple of org examples to pass to GithubOrgClient, in this order:

* `google`
* `abc`
Of course, no external HTTP calls should be made.


**File**: `test_client.py`



### 5. Mocking a property


`memoize` turns methods into properties. Read up on how to mock a property (see resource).

Implement the `test_public_repos_url` method to unit-test `GithubOrgClient._public_repos_url`.

Use `patch` as a context manager to patch `GithubOrgClient.org` and make it return a known payload.

Test that the result of `_public_repos_url` is the expected one based on the mocked payload.
