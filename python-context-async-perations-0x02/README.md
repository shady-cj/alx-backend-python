# Key Concepts

## Context Managers

Context managers ensure proper resource acquisition and release using the with statement pattern. The `enter` method handles resource setup, while `exit` guarantees cleanup even if exceptions occur.

## Database Connection Management

Proper connection management prevents resource leaks and ensures database integrity. Context managers automatically handle connection opening/closing.

## Asynchronous Programming

Using async/await syntax with aiosqlite enables non-blocking database operations, allowing multiple queries to execute concurrently for improved performance.

## Concurrent Execution

`asyncio.gather()` allows multiple asynchronous operations to run simultaneously, significantly reducing total execution time for independent queries.
